**I DO NOT CONDONE USE OF SUCH APPLICATIONS ON A MASS SCALE, OR USE OF A "BOTNET". SOME PEOPLE ARE SPREADING MALICIOUS MALWARE CAMPAIGNS THROUGH DEVICES EVERYDAY. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN ONYXRAT ON HACKFORUMS, WHICH WAS A BASIC ANDROID SPY MALWARE, ALLOWING YOU TO INSTALL ANDROID SPYWARE ON ANY ANDROID PHONE, FOR A PRICE.

THIS IS SIMPLY FOR CYBERSECURITY AND INFOSEC RESEARCH. DO NOT USE ANY OF THE CODE MALICIOUSLY.
